The doctor tree uses a binary tree structure where each node represents 
a doctor that has two direct reports. Recersive travel is used for flexability,
preorder is from a topdown view from the managements perspective. This also
is designed for balancing listings and review chains making it simple to travel 
around the hierachy maintaing readability with logical flow. The emergancy queue
uses a miniheap to manage patients on a severity level. This means the most
urgant cases will always be put up to the top of the list guarinteeing O(1)
acess time for the most sever patients. Both do have tradeoffs like with the 
Doctor tree priortizing clartity and traveling the tree while the miniheap
is big on run time and automatic order maintance. I feel this was the best way 
to set up a good mirror for the real world set up that can be improve performance
scalability and maintainability when it comes from a point of emergance work.
